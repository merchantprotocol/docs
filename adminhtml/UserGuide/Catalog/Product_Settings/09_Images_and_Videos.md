Images and Videos
--

From the Images and Videos section, you can perform basic image management tasks such as upload multiple images, rearrange the order of images, and control how each image is used. For additional control over individual images you can open each image in “detail view.” To learn more, see: Catalog Images and Video.

1.	Open the product in edit mode.
