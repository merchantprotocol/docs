Simple Product
--

One of the keys to harnessing the power of product types is learning when to use a simple, standalone product. A simple product can be sold individually, or as part of a grouped, configurable, or bundle product. A simple product with custom options is sometimes referred to as a composite product.

The following instructions take you through the process of creating a simple product using a product template, required fields, and basic settings. Each required field is marked with a red asterisk (*). When you finish the basics, you can complete the advanced settings and other settings as needed.
