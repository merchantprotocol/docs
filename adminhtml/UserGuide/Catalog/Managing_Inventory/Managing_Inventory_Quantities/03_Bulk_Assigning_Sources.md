Bulk Assigning Sources
--

Use the Assign Sources tool to add one or more sources to your products. The tool helps when creating and assigning custom sources to your Default Stock or custom stocks and preparing new locations and inventory.

After adding new custom sources, you can add inventory quantities per product or for multiple products through the Admin or using the import feature.

## To update quantities:

1.	On the Admin sidebar, tap **Catalog**. Then, choose **Products**.
2.	Select the products you want to modify sources. Browse or search to find the products and select those checkboxes.
3.	Tap the **Actions** drop-down menu, and choose Assign Inventory Source. Tap OK to verify.
