Product Workspace
--

The product workspace is basically the same for all product types, although the selection of fields changes depending on the attribute set that is used. The product attributes are at the top of the form, followed by expandable sections of product information. When a new product is saved for the first time, the Store View chooser appears in the upper-left of the form.

The online status of the product is indicated by the switch at the top of the form. To change the online status, simply set the Enable Product switch to the “Yes” or “No” position.
