Creating Products
--

Choosing a product type is one of the first things you must do to create a new product. In this section, you will learn how to create a product of each type. In addition to the basic product types, the term, complex product is sometimes used to refer to products with multiple options, such as a configurable product that is available in various colors and sizes. To learn more about the available options, see Product Settings and Advanced Settings.

If you are just starting out, you can create a few sample products to experiment with each product type. For a deeper understanding, make sure to read about catalog navigation, how to set up categories and attributes, and the catalog URL options that are available to you.

After you learn the basics, the most efficient way to add a large number of products to the catalog is to import them from a CSV file.
