## Related Products

Related products are meant to be purchased in addition to the item the customer is viewing. The customer can place the item in the shopping cart by simply clicking the checkbox. The placement of the Related Products block varies according to theme and page layout. In the example below, it appears at the bottom of the Product View page. With a 2 column layout, the Related Product block often appears in the right sidebar.

## Up-sells

Up-sell products are items that your customer might prefer instead of the product currently considered. An item offered as an up-sell might be of a higher quality, more popular, or have better profit margin. Up-sell products appear on the product page under a heading such as, “You may also be interested in the following product(s).”

## Cross-sells

Cross-sell items are similar to impulse purchases positioned next to the cash register in the checkout line. Products offered as a cross-sell appear on the shopping cart page, just before the customer begins the checkout process.

> To show or hide cross-sell items per store view, see the Store > Configuration > Sales > Checkout > Shopping Cart option called Show Cross-sell Items in the Shopping Cart. You may want to hide cross-sells during specific sales or for A/B testing in a store view.
