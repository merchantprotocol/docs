Path to Purchase
--

The path customers follow that leads to a sale is sometimes called the “path to purchase.” In this quick tour, we’ll take a look at pages of strategic value that customers usually visit while shopping in your store. Then, we’ll consider different store features that can be leveraged at each stage of the customer journey.

## Home Page

Your home page is like the front window display of your store. As the primary landing page, its design entices visitors to come inside for a closer look.

## Catalog Page

This page shows products from your catalog in either a list or grid format. The selection can be based on a category chosen from the main menu, a choice made in the layered navigation on the left, or the results of a search. Any item can be examined in more detail, or placed directly into the shopping cart.

## Search Results

Did you know that people who use search are nearly twice as likely to make a purchase as those who rely on navigation alone? You might consider these shoppers to be “pre-qualified.”

## Product Page

The product page provides detailed information about a specific item in your catalog. Shoppers can read reviews, add the product to their wish lists, compare it to other products, share the link with friends, and most importantly, place the item into their shopping carts.

## Shopping Cart

The shopping cart lists each item by price and quantity selected, and calculates the subtotal. Shoppers can apply discount coupons, and generate an estimate of shipping and tax charges.
