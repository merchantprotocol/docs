Deleting Stocks
--
When you delete the stock, all assigned web sites are assigned to the Default Stock. We recommend reassigning websites to other stocks prior to deletion.

> **Important**: Deleting a stock can affect salable quantities and unprocessed orders for a sales channel. If you continue using a sales channel, please add the sales channel to another existing or new stock.

1.	On the Admin sidebar, tap **Stores**. Then under Inventory, choose **Stocks**.
2.	Select one or more stocks you want to delete. Browse or search and select checkboxes for stocks you want to delete.
3.	From the Actions drop-down menu, select **Delete**.
