Expanding and Restructuring Inventory
--

As your business grows and changes, Inventory Management supports your needs. You can expand to a Multi Source merchant or reduce down to a Single Source merchant with ease.

## To expand to Multi Source:

Single Source merchants may add new stores, warehouses, drop shippers, and more. Expanding requires only a few additions and stock updates to expand to multisourcing:

* Add custom sources for each new location. You will only use the Default Source for Bundle products.
* Add custom stocks as needed for your new sources. For example, you may want to create stocks per website, country, locale, or other method. You can assign sources to your custom stocks. You will only use the Default Stock for Bundle products.
* Update source assignments and quantities for your products. You can also use the Mass Actions Tool and Magento Import-Export feature to quickly add sources and product data.

## To restructure to Single Source:

For Multi Source merchants wanting to reduce online sales to one location for shipping, modify your sources, stock, and quantities to update:

* Disable custom sources.
* Transfer product inventory to your Default Source. We recommend using mass actions. See Transferring Inventory to Source.
* Assign all websites to the Default Stock.
