Uploading Product Images
--

For each product, you can upload multiple images, rearrange their order images, and control how each image is used. If you have a large quantity of images to manage, you might prefer to import them as a batch, rather than upload each one individually. To learn more, see Importing Product Images.

If you intend to upload large images for viewing on the Product Details page, you may want to consider setting a maximum pixel size (width and height) and automatically resizing the files prior to upload. We provide an option to enable automatic resizing of significantly larger image files as you upload. To learn more, see Resizing Product Images.

## To manage images:

1.	Open the product in edit mode.
2.	To work with a specific store view, set the **Store View** chooser in the upper-left corner to the applicable view.
3.	Scroll down and expand the Images and Videos section. Then, do any of the following:

Image Alt text is referenced by screen readers to improve web accessibility, and by search engines when indexing the site. Some browsers display the Alt text on mouseover. Alt text can be several words long, and include carefully selected key words.
