Design Settings
--

The Design section gives you control over the look and feel of a category, all associated product pages, and page layout. You can customize a category page and its associated products for a promotion, or to differentiate the category. For example, you might develop a distinctive design for a brand or special line of products, or apply an update for a specific period of time.
