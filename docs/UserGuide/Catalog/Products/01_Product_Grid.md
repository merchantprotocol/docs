Product Grid
--

All products in the catalog are accessible from the Products page, where you can create new products and edit existing ones. For a multisite installation, each website can offer a different selection of products for sale from the same catalog.

The Products grid lists all products in the catalog, indicates the website(s) where they are available, and if they are currently enabled for sale.

You can browse through the list page by page, or search for specific products. Use the standard controls to sort and filter the list, and apply actions to selected products.
