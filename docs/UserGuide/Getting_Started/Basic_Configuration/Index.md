Basic Configuration
--

This section of the guide introduces your store's Admin, and walks you through the basic configuration settings. You’ll learn the concepts of store hierarchy and configuration scope, and establish best practices for industry standards and requirements.

## Store Admin

Your store Admin is the password-protected back office where you can set up products, promotions, manage orders, and perform other administrative tasks.

## Store Details

This is where you can enter the basic information about your store, including the store name and address, contacts, language, and currency.

## Storefront Branding

One of the first things you’ll want to do is to change the logo in the header, and upload a favicon for the browser. You’ll also learn how to update the copyright notice in the footer, and how to use the store demo notice.

## Websites, Stores & Views

A Magento installation can include multiple websites, stores, and views in different languages, all managed from the same Admin.

## Industry Compliance

Merchants are responsible to meet industry guidelines for maintaining a secure environment, and to meet the legal requirements and best practices for online merchants in their jurisdiction.
